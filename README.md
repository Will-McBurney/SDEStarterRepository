# SDEStarterRepository

REPLACE THIS README WITH THE README YOUR TEAM NEEDS FOR THE ASSIGNMENT

Many SDE assignments will be deployed with this repository. To start working in the repository:

1) Clone the repository onto your machine into a new folder

2) Navigate to that folder in terminal/powershell (That is, be in the same folder as the gradlew file)

3) Type:

./gradlew  

MAC NOTE:

If the above doesn't work, use:

chmod +x ./gradlew  
./gradlew  

4) To open project in Eclipse:

4.1) In build.gradle, uncomment out the "apply plugin: 'eclipse'" line.

4.2) Open Eclipse and go to File->Import...->Gradle->Exising Gradle Project, then set the directory as the folder this README is in

4.3) A note on Eclipse, after you add new dependencies, right click your project, go to Gradle -> Refresh Gradle Project. This will ensure that Eclipse will give appropriate syntax highlighting/auto-complete.
